@ FILE FORMAT:

@ Result file:
    # First line: in format of: "(int)," for any death.
            - points of time of deaths if any. 
    # Second line: in format of: "(int)totalPoints, (int)health". 
            - at the end of the screen if passed the screen.
    # Third line: in format of:"(int)"
            - points of time when pacman finished the screen - (ate all the breadcrumbs)

@ Steps file:
    # every line is in the same format.
    # the format is:
        - "(int)point of time" 
        - ","
        - "(char) pacman move direction (U/D/L/R)"
        - ","
        -"(int)amount of ghosts"
        - ","
        - for each gohst is direction: "(char) ghost move direction (U/D/L/R)"
        - ","
        - after each ghost direction there is two options:
            - 1. fruit is created / deleted -> there will be indicator "F" for fruit.
                - after that will be the x , y and init fruit val.
                - In the end the format will be like so: "F, initX, initY, val". 
            - 2. fruit is alive -> there will be a fruit move direction in fromat of : 
                 "(char) fruit move direction (U/D/L/R)"

    # Examples:
        - 1. There is 3 ghosts and no fruit:
            - "5,R,3,U,R,U"
        - 2. There is 3 ghosts and fruit is first created:
            - "32,U,3,S,S,S,F,6,5,9"
        - 3. There is 3 ghosts and fruit is already created:
            - "33,U,3,L,U,L,R"
        - 4. There is 3 ghosts and fruit is deleted:
            - "33,U,3,L,U,L,F,0,0,0"
